            <h2>The Blue Umbrella</h2>
            <p>- Ruskin Bond</p>
            <h1></h1>
            <p> <b>The Blue Umbrella has, so far, gathered immense applaud from readers and critics alike.  This is a short novel, but the kind of moral lessons it teaches to us are simply overwhelming.
          This is a story of Binya, a poor little girl living with her mother and an elder brother, Bijju, in a small hilly village of Garhwal. One day while herding her two cows back home, she stumbles upon some city people enjoying the picnic in the valley. She is enthralled to see them well-groomed and rich. She craves to be one like them and among many other things of their, a blue frilly umbrella catches her attention. She begins craving for it. On the other hand, the city people get attracted by her innocent beauty and the pendant in her neck. The pendant consists of leopard’s claw – which is considered a mascot widely in the hills. Binya trades her pendant off with the blue umbrella.
        The blue umbrella is so much beautiful that soon it becomes a topic of conversation for villagers and children adore her umbrella so much that every time they feel like to touch or hold it. Binya is on seventh heaven and rarely closes it because she believes it looks charming when it is opened.
         Ram Bharosa runs a small shop where he sells food items, grocery, and soft drinks without a refrigerator. He is so much envied by the umbrella that he decides to own it at any condition. So, he extends a proposal for buying the umbrella from Binya. But she refuses the offer. The refusal turns him off. Very soon, he hires a boy from the neighboring village to work at his shop. The boy being loyal to him steals the umbrella from Binya when she is out in the jungle collecting porcupines quills.
           Ironically, the boy is caught by Bijju. When the boy reveals Ram Bharosa’s name behind the stealing, the villagers ostracize him and also stop visiting his shop. As a result, Ram Bharosa suffers a loss and his livelihood comes on the verge of end.
         Binya feels sad about Ram Bharosa’s situation and she reproaches herself for his suffering.
